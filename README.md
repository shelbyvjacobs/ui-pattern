# UI Pattern

### Description

This page combined my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create an interactive website with up-to-date information drawn from the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/).

### Goals

My goals for this project included:
* Connect to an API and fetch information to populate the page.
* Utilize UI patterns for and interactive user experience.

### Example

Below is a screenshot of the default page.

This is how the page appears when the modal is active.

And finally, this is what the page looks like when the accordian is open.

### Features

I connected with the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API and fetched the current day's photo, title, date, and description. Then, I improved the functionality using Javascript by adding a modal that increases the size of the image when it is clicked by a user. I also added an accordian that expands to reveal the full description of the photo.

### Technologies Used

This website was created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and information from the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API.
